# Alcohol Consumption Research

Research project on Probability&Statistics course at UCU

## About

This is a research project on the alcohol consumption among students. The datasets used are taken from  kaggle (link provided).
The report shows the dependencies of the level of alcohol consumption among american students on different factors, e.g. age,social life, time spent on studies, etc. The level of alcohol consumption were recorded both on workdays and weekends, providing more precise data and more hypothesis to analyse.

The report is available [here](https://github.com/linvieson/alcohol-consumption-research/blob/main/Report.pdf) as pdf file.

The original datasets are available [by this link](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption) and in [datasets folder](https://github.com/linvieson/alcohol-consumption-research/tree/main/datasets) on the repository.

## Conclusion

The result of the work is a complete research with analysis of dependensies between the level of alcohol consumption and other factors.

The hypothesis testing (via chi-squared test for independence) showed the dependency of the alcohol consumption level on the time students spend studying.

The linear regression model predicts the alcohol consumption level with 61% precision.
